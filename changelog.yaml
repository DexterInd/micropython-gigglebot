v1.0.0:
  title: GiggleBot MicroPython Firmware v1.0.0
  body:
    - official release.
v0.4.0:
  title: GiggleBot MicroPython Firmware v0.4.0
  body:
    - Fix the Distance Sensor getting into conflict with the Light and Color sensor on the I2C line - change the
      address to a different one. Add note about the conflicts induced by the Distance Sensor in the docs.
    - Simplify the `gigglebot_advanced.py` module and rename it to `gb_diag.py`.
    - Add read methods for each add-on sensor in the `gigglebot.py` module; the read methods abstract the init
      and slightly more complex read methods from each sensor class. 
v0.3.2:
  title: GiggleBot MicroPython Firmware v0.3.2
  body:
    - Change how the documentation is organized.
    - Use direct links to the generated python modules for each version in the documentation (on the S3 bucket). Make the
      documentation _reactive_, depending on which branch the documentation gets built upon.
v0.3.1:
  title: GiggleBot MicroPython Firmware v0.3.1
  body:
    - Push artifacts to AWS S3 for easy access for anyone that only wants to click on a link and download
      an artifact (module) - instead of going to GitHub and manually look for a version.
v0.3.0:
  title: GiggleBot MicroPython Firmware v0.3.0
  body:
    - Reduce the size of the firmware by removing the compass (~14KB) and
      the SPI (~2.1KB) modules to make room for the other DI Sensors, thus gaining a total of ~16KB.
    - Update version of micropython from upstream (nothing too serious).
    - Add `thp.py` and `lightcolor.py` modules for the *Temperature Humidity Pressure Sensor* and
      respectively the *Light and Color Sensor*.
    - Update the documentation according to the latest changes.
v0.2.0:
  title: GiggleBot MicroPython Firmware v0.2.0
  body:
    - Add sphinx documentation for readthedocs.org which includes some tutorials and the API description
      of `gigglebot.py`/`gigglebot_advanced.py`/`distance_sensor.py` modules.
    - Add less complex module called the `gigglebot.py` and rename the old one to `gigglebot_advanced.py`.
    - Optimize `gigglebot.py` module for the microbit board to use less RAM.
    - Fix formatting and semantic issues in the documentation.
    - Fix syntax and logic issues in `gigglebot_advanced.py` module (which is the old module called `gigglebot.py`).
    - Minify python modules before integrating them into the firmware.
    - Add `usedspace.txt` file as build artifact to indicate the size in bytes of the firmware.
v0.1.0:
  title: GiggleBot MicroPython Firmware v0.1.0
  body:
    - Came up with the solution to integrate python modules directly within the firmware of the microbit.
      More details can be seen here https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/micropython/issues/555.
    - Enabled the import of frozen modules, pre-compiled python modules and `memoryview` class.
    - Automated the building instructions of the micropython firmware for the gigglebot/microbit. Used docker
      to simply it even more and to allow for building it on Windows machines.
    - Reduced the number of recursions to a minimum with the distance sensor library 
      and made it not use much RAM memory when imported.
    - Added the gigglebot library to this release.
    - Added build server (with Travis-CI) and automated the release of new versions.
