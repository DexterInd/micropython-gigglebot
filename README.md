## GiggleBot MicroPython for the BBC Micro:bit 
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DexterInd/micropython-gigglebot.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DexterInd/micropython-gigglebot) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/gigglebot/badge/?version=stable)](https://gigglebot.readthedocs.io/en/stable/?badge=stable)

This is the repository for the MicroPython that's running on the BBC micro:bit + GiggleBot robot.

This firmware, when compared to [bbcmicrobit/micropython](https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/micropython), has libraries to support the collection of sensors that go on a GiggleBot. Also, there are a couple of features enabled that allow the use of pre-compiled modules on the microbit and others that permit the better use of the memory.

Check the documentation for more details.

Artifacts can be found on the release page or on [this S3 bucket](https://dexind.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html#micropython-gigglebot/firmware/).

## Building It

Running the following commands are enough to build the firmware locally.
```bash
docker image build -t gigglebot-micropython src
docker container run --name gigglebot gigglebot-micropython
docker container cp gigglebot:/src/gupy/build/firmware.hex build/
docker container cp gigglebot:/src/tmp/ build/
```

This can take up to 5-8 minutes to finish so go grab a coffee. 

When it's done, a `firmware.hex` will show up in `build` directory. In the `build` directory there's also going to be a `tmp` directory containing `mpy` and `py` files of the libraries that get compiled into the firmware.

The last thing to do is to copy paste the `firmware.hex` to the microbit. 

## Project Structure

* **docs** - Contains the ReadTheDocs documentation.
* **integration** - Scripts required by the CI system.
* **misc** - Various useful tools. At the moment it only contains the color picker for HSV values.
* **src** - The python libraries for the GiggleBot + DI-Sensors along with the Dockerfile and other custom source/header files.
    * **inc** - Custom header files used to reduce the size of the firmware.
    * **source** - Custom source files used to reduce the size of the firmware.
* **static** - Photo with the GiggleBot.
